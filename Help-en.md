## 🌷 Hello!!! Welcome to Alpha V2ray 🤗
🙋‍♂️ Now let's see how to use this app and how to use this app to get free internet. You can use this app in several ways.

### 01. Through the Servers provided by the App
📚 Introduction :- You all know that when using a VPN, we connect to a separate server. In that case, you must have a server to connect to the VPN (as you know, you need a VPN file ), so we have added some of our selected Fast & Secure Servers to our App for your convenience. Therefore, you can select one from the server list and connect to VPN. Now let's see how to use this app for both Normal VPN and Free Internet VPN methods.

##### 1. For Free Internet VPN 
🔥 You may already know about Free Internet VPN, otherwise you can see the full details about it on our @VPN_Stock Channel. First you have to select a server with a good PING from the server list, then select the package you have activated from the package list in the app . Now click the Connect Button in the middle (Give VPN Access Ok). When you connect the VPN, a notification will appear with the name of the selected package. You can check the PING of the VPN by clicking the status label in the middle of the app. If everything is fine, now you can use Free Internet as much as possible 🎉

💡 Important :-

When selecting servers for Free Internet, select Vless, Vmess, and Trojan servers. 
When choosing a package, choose a package that supports your package
Please check server PING after Connected to VPN ( Click Status Label )
Connected but not loading , then Enable Local DNS

##### 2. For Normal VPN 
☀️ Change the location If you use the app as a normal VPN, you can select any server from the server list, select Default Config from the package list and connect. ( It is better if you use a gRPC server or Shadowsocks in normal VPN)

### 02. By Custom Servers / Config
🛠 You can add any type of V2ray created from a website or from your own server to the App. This Config can be added by copying and using the Clipboard or by scanning the QR Code and the App also has the facility to edit them. Even for a custom config that you have added, you can connect VPN to the package by selecting it from the package list of the app without editing for a separate package. 🎉

### 03. By Alpha Config File (.alph)
🚀 If you have an Alph file specific to the Alpha V2ray App , you can open that file directly from the App and connect it. Select Import Config File from Main Menu to import Manula File . It is not possible to edit these files and the server that has the file is VPN connected through the tunnel method. The person who creates the Alph V2ray file usually mentions the description of this file and the package it supports in the description. To view the description related to the file, after importing the file, click where the Config File ICON is shown or where the package is shown. Select Clear Current Config from the Main Menu to remove the file . If you also want to create an Alph Config File @AlphaV2rayBOTUse Telegram BOT . 👑

### 04. Manula Type Config
🌿 The app also has the ability to manually type and add config. For that, select Create New Config from the menu that appears when you click on the Add button in the Main Menu or at the bottom of the Custom Server List. The App has the facility to Edit, Delete & Share every Config you add. ( QR & Clipboard Share ) ✅

### 🖥 How to connect VPN to laptop using the app
☘️ After connecting the VPN through the App from the Android Phone, Allow Connections From The LAN in the Settings of the AppActivate the facility. Then you can add the IP of the phone and the proxy port of the app to the proxy settings of the laptop or PC you want to connect to the free internet and connect to that device as well ✅ This method does not require any additional software for any OS (Windows / Linux / MAC ) is supported and it is possible to connect even through software like PadNet. Even using a software like Proxifier can make this easier. The connecting laptop or PC must be on the same network as Moblie. Get a full video tutorial on how to do this through our Telegram group. Using this method, you can share Free Internet VPN even to other mobiles on the same WiFi network

### ⚡️ Using the App through Proxy
🎯  This App can be used by both VPN and Proxy method. In the VPN method, the VPN works for the entire mobile. In the Proxy Method, the VPN is provided as a Local Proxy Server without running the VPN Service, this method helps to connect and use the VPN only for the relevant applications and also helps to save the battery of the device. This method can be used for any app that supports proxy. For example, for the Telegram app, you can click this [link](https://t.me/socks?server=127.0.0.1&port=10808) and connect the proxy to the app. Access Settings (Socks5 / HTTP >>> Localhost) to get Proxy Port.

#### ◈─────── Important ────────◈

Each free server provided by the app can be used continuously for 15 days and you can refresh the server list and renew the servers whenever you want . (If the current servers are not connecting, it is because the server list is not updated in your app,  so remember to keep the server list updated )
The validity and speed of the existing packages of the App are dependent on the respective ISP. Ask our group to know more about it . (If there is no package that supports your package in the app, import an Alph file that supports your package through the @VPN_Stock Telegram channel. If there is a package that needs to be added to the app, please inform our Support BOT with all its details through a request message)
The App also has the facility to connect VPN only to the relevant Apps, for that visit Per-App Proxy from Settings.
Use Local DNS and Fake DNS in Settings for services like Ad Blocking.
Alph Config Files have the ability to add an icon of your choice and support HTML when adding a description .
If you are using a MI or Huawei phone, keep this app pinned in the Recent App List to stop the VPN from stopping during RAM cleaning.
